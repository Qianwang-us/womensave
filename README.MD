### What it does
Lily(womensave) is a retirement savings calculator and tracker.

We take in users' current income, current age and expected retirement age.

We calculate their pre-retirement income, savings required at time of retirement and the monthly savings amount. Our built-in tracker helps ensure consistency and tracks any savings deposits.
